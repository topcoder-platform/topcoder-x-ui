## GitHub OAuth App Setup

These instructions should be used to generate the GITHUB_CLIENT_ID and GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET values for configuration

- Login into github.com
- Click the upper right avatar, then click `Settings`
- Click the left panel --> Developer settings --> OAuth Apps
- Click the `Register a new application`, fill in the fields,
  note that the `Authorization callback URL` should be the deployed topcoder-x web site,
  for local deployment, it should be `http://topcoderx.topcoder-dev.com`
- After creating the OAuth app, you can see its client id and client secret,
  these should be set to GITHUB_CLIENT_ID and GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET environment variables

## GitLab OAuth App Setup

These instructions should be used to generate the GITLAB_CLIENT_ID and GITLAB_CLIENT_SECRET values for configuration


- Login into gitlab.com
- Click the upper right avatar, then click `Settings`
- Click the `Applications` tab
- Enter an application name, e.g. `Topcoder-X`
- For Redirect URI, enter two callback URLs, one callback URL per line, so there are two lines:
  http://topcoderx.topcoder-dev.com/api/v1/gitlab/owneruser/callback
 http://topcoderx.topcoder-dev.com/api/v1/gitlab/normaluser/callback
- For Scopes, check the `api` and `read_user`, the `api` is for owner user, the `read_user` is for normal user
- Finally, click `Save application` to save the OAuth app, then you will see its generated Application Id and Secret,
  these should be set to GITLAB_CLIENT_ID and GITLAB_CLIENT_SECRET environment variables

  ## Topcoder environment

  Application depends upon the environment of Topcoder based on TOPCODER_ENV configuration. When this value is 'dev' you should be using topcoderx.topcoder-dev.com.

  To switch to production, simply change the TOPCODER_DEV to 'prod' and use topcoderx.topcoder.com

  Default configuration is for topcoder-dev environment.
